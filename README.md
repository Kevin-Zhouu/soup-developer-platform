### Project Published: 2018 (during my Junior High School years) 👨‍🎓

#### Built with ❤️ ✨
- 💡 Developed with enthusiasm and a strong desire to help junior developers easily track their app usage.
- ⚠️ Some design choices, commit messages, and coding style that were not optimal due to limited experience at the time.

#### Successful Onboarding 
- 👥 Onboarded over 50 developers onto the platform, receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback.
- ⛔ Unfortunately, the platform was shut down due to high server costs, as I had limited financial resources as a middle school student.

### Functionalities 📋
- Track Total Visits (TV) and Unique Visitors (UV) to gather usage statistics.
- Display visualisations of historical app usage on the frontend.
- Manage and upload app versions, integrating with IaaS storage service (UCloud).
- Send update notifications to client applications.

### Technology Stack 💻
- Backend: PHP (RESTful API and MVC pattern), MySQL, Redis.
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
- Hosted on Linux (Ubuntu 17) VPS instance

### Above all: Passion! ❤️
